# CS539-Final-Project

## Project Scope
 
In this project, we are proposing a tool to generate ‘friendships’ based on musical preferences and playlist composition of Spotify users. The tool will take a user’s Spotify playlist(s) as input and create matches with other Spotify users based on an algorithmic compatibility of the audio features of songs within each playlist.

In this repository you will find the following directories:
1. Models: It includes 4 different files for the 4 different models that we developed for clustering the data. Each file includes preprocessing steps. 
  1.1 K-means script
  1.2 DBSCAN
  1.3 OPTICS
  1.4 Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
