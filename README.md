# CS539-Final-Project

## Project Scope
 
In this project, we are proposing a tool to generate ‘friendships’ based on musical preferences and playlist composition of Spotify users. The tool will take a user’s Spotify playlist(s) as input and create matches with other Spotify users based on an algorithmic compatibility of the audio features of songs within each playlist.
